# A Whirlwind Tour of QIIME 2

This repository contains information for my QIIME 2 presentation/mini-workshop at [Microbiome Analysis in the Cloud](http://www.igs.umaryland.edu/topics/microbiome-cloud/) at the Institute for Genome Sciences, University of Maryland School of Medicine on 15 June 2017. The accompanying slides can be found at [http://bit.ly/q2-igs-2017](http://bit.ly/q2-igs-2017).

The commands used in this workshop can be found in the [workshop-commands.md](./workshop-commands.md) file in this repository. These commands were tested on AWS `ami-21530437`, but should work on any system with a working QIIME 2 2017.5 deployment.

For more information about QIIME 2, see https://qiime2.org. If you're interested in attending a future QIIME 2 workshop, please see https://workshops.qiime2.org.
